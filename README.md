# Weave Coding Challenge
This challenge has been broken up into two separate quizzes: [Go](./go) and [React+Redux](./react/hello-world). The order in which you do these quizzes is entirely up to you.

Please fork this project and solve on your Github account. Then when you are finished, send us a pull request.

If you would rather, you can clone this repo and send us a zipped copy of your work when you are done.

Let us know if you have any questions: dev@weaveiq.com
